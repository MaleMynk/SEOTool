This project is a web development project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a tech stack. The objective is to create an SEO analyzer website that takes a URL as an input and analyzes factors such as keyword density, images, videos, alt text, etc. to come up with a detailed analysis of how good the site is based on SEO.

The website is designed to help website owners and digital marketers improve their website's SEO performance by providing them with detailed analysis and suggestions for optimization. Users can enter the URL of their website and the system will generate a report that outlines the various SEO factors and provides suggestions for optimization.

The web development team used HTML to structure the website, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the logic and interactivity. 

To analyze the various SEO factors, the team used various techniques such as web scraping, keyword analysis, and image and video analysis. The system is designed to analyze the website and provide a comprehensive report that covers all the relevant SEO factors.

Overall, the SEO Analyzer project is a great example of how web development can be used to create tools that help website owners and digital marketers improve their website's SEO performance. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive analysis, the SEO Analyzer is a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve their website's SEO performance.

In further stages we will use MERN Stack to enhance the functionalities of the project. Also we’ll try to make this process work for bulk URL’s so that we can use it as a personal tool. 

Whenever we want to revamp out website we can use this tool to enter url’s in bulk maybe 50-100 and our tool will analyze all the webpages on most crucial SEO factors that can save them a lot of time and money. They won’t have to do it manually anymore
